## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Better understanding of tables and list styling

### Continued development

I completed this challenge relatively quickly and achieved a design that closely resembles the original (without access to any Figma files, only based on screenshots). However, I had to do some research on how to style lists and couldn't recall the exact method for styling tables.
